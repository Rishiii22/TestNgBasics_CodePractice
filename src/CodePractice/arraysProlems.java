Examples:

Input: n = 5, arr[] = [1,2,3,5]
Output: 4
Explanation : All the numbers from 1 to 5 are present except 4.
Input: n = 2, arr[] = [1]
Output: 2

	 * You have given two sorted arrays arr1[] & arr2[] of distinct elements. The first array has one element extra added in between. Return the index of the extra element.

Note: 0-based indexing is followed.

Examples

Input: n = 7, arr1[] = {2,4,6,8,9,10,12}, arr2[] = {2,4,6,8,10,12}
Output: 4
Explanation: In the first array, 9 is extra added and it's index is 4.
Input: n = 6, arr1[] = {3,5,7,8,11,13}, arr2[] = {3,5,7,11,13}
Output: 3
Explanation: In the first array, 8 is extra and it's index is 3.

Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1).

	 * Given a sorted array containing only 0s and 1s, find the transition point, i.e., the first index where 1 was observed, and before that, only 0 was observed.

Example 1:

Input:
N = 5
arr[] = {0,0,0,1,1}
Output: 3
Explanation: index 3 is the transition 
point where 1 begins.
Example 2:

Input:
N = 4
arr[] = {0,0,0,0}
Output: -1
Explanation: Since, there is no "1",
the answer is -1.
Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. The task is to complete the function transitionPoint() 
that takes array arr and N as input parameters and returns the 0-based index of the position where 0 ends
 and 1 begins. If array does not have any 1, return -1. If array does not have any 0, return 0.
